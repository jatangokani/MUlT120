The best way to serve a PB&J is in donut form. With the help of Uncrustables,
you can whip up PB&J (or just peanut butter, or chocolate-hazelnut, you get the idea) donuts in just 15 minutes.
Cinnamon sugar gives the outside a nice, churro-like crunch, which perfectly complements the creamy center.

Ingredients:
1 uncrustables sandwiches
1 uncrustables sandwiches
4 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Step: 1
Preheat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.

Step: 2
Meanwhile, use a 1-inch cutter to cut a hole in the center of each Uncrustable.
Press edges around the center of the hole to seal sandwich closed in the middle

Step: 3
Fry each sandwich in hot oil until browned, 8 to 10 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels.

Step: 4
Stir together sugar and cinnamon on a plate; dredge donuts lightly in cinnamon sugar.
